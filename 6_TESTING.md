# 6. Testing

## Unit Testing Guidelines

**Purpose:**

- Unit testing ensures the individual units of code (e.g., functions, methods, classes) behave as expected in isolation. It helps identify bugs early in the development process, validate code changes, and maintain code quality.

**Guidelines:**

- Write unit tests for critical and complex code paths, edge cases, and business logic to ensure robustness and reliability.
- Use Flutter's built-in testing framework (e.g., `flutter_test`) or third-party testing libraries (e.g., `mockito`) to write and execute unit tests.
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern to structure unit tests into setup, execution, and verification phases.
- Aim for high test coverage to mitigate the risk of regressions and ensure comprehensive test coverage across the codebase.

## Widget Testing Guidelines

**Purpose:**

- Widget testing verifies the behavior and appearance of Flutter widgets under various scenarios and user interactions. It helps ensure that UI components render correctly and respond appropriately to user input.

**Guidelines:**

- Write widget tests to validate the rendering, layout, and behavior of individual widgets or widget trees.
- Use Flutter's testing utilities (e.g., `WidgetTester`) to interact with widgets, simulate user interactions, and verify widget properties and states.
- Mock external dependencies, such as services or APIs, to isolate widget tests and focus on testing widget behavior in isolation.
- Incorporate golden tests to visually compare widget renderings against expected snapshots and detect visual regressions.

## Integration Testing Guidelines

**Purpose:**

- Integration testing validates the interactions and integration between different components, modules, or subsystems of the application. It ensures that the various parts of the system work together harmoniously and meet the specified requirements.

**Guidelines:**

- Write integration tests to verify end-to-end workflows, user journeys, or cross-component interactions within the application.
- Use Flutter's integration testing framework (e.g., `flutter_driver`) to automate user interactions, navigate through screens, and verify system behavior.
- Set up test environments and configurations to simulate real-world conditions, such as network connectivity, device orientation, and device hardware.
- Integrate integration tests into the CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and ensure consistent test coverage across different environments.
