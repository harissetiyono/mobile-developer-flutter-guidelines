# 7. Dependency Management

## Package Management Best Practices

**Purpose:**

- Effective package management facilitates the integration of third-party dependencies into Flutter projects, enabling developers to leverage existing libraries, frameworks, and tools to accelerate development and enhance functionality.

**Guidelines:**

- Use the pub package manager to manage dependencies in Flutter projects, leveraging the extensive ecosystem of packages available on pub.dev.
- Regularly update project dependencies to leverage bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features provided by package maintainers.
- Vet third-party packages carefully, considering factors such as popularity, maintenance status, community support, and compatibility with the project's requirements.

## Handling Third-Party Dependencies

**Purpose:**

- Third-party dependencies extend the functionality of Flutter projects by providing pre-built solutions for common tasks, such as UI components, state management, and network communication. Properly managing third-party dependencies ensures their seamless integration and compatibility with the project.

**Guidelines:**

- Evaluate the necessity of each third-party dependency and consider alternatives before adding it to the project.
- Use dependency injection techniques to decouple the project code from specific implementations and facilitate testing and maintainability.
- Monitor third-party dependencies for security vulnerabilities, licensing issues, and compatibility concerns, and update them promptly to mitigate risks.

## Versioning Strategy

**Purpose:**

- A versioning strategy defines how versions of the project and its dependencies are managed and incremented over time. Consistent versioning enables developers to track changes, manage releases, and communicate compatibility and stability information effectively.

**Guidelines:**

- Follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer) principles to assign version numbers based on backward compatibility, breaking changes, and feature additions.
- Increment the major version for backward-incompatible changes, the minor version for backward-compatible feature additions, and the patch version for backward-compatible bug fixes.
- Use version constraints in the pubspec.yaml file to specify acceptable ranges of dependency versions, ensuring compatibility while allowing for updates.
