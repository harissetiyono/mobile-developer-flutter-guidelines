# 10. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

## CI/CD Setup Instructions

**Purpose:**

- Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software changes, enabling faster delivery of high-quality software with minimal manual intervention. Setting up CI/CD pipelines streamlines the development workflow and improves productivity, reliability, and consistency.

**Guidelines:**

- Choose a CI/CD platform or service that integrates seamlessly with Flutter projects and supports essential features such as automated builds, testing, and deployment.
- Configure CI/CD pipelines to trigger automatically on code commits or pull requests, ensuring that changes are validated and integrated into the codebase promptly.
- Define stages in the CI/CD pipeline, including build, test, code analysis, and deployment, to orchestrate the sequence of actions performed on each code change.
- Configure environment variables, secrets, and permissions securely to protect sensitive information and ensure that only authorized users or processes can access critical resources.
