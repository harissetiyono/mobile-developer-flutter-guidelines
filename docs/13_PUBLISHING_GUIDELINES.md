# 13. Publishing Guidelines

## App Store Submission Requirements

**Purpose:**

- Publishing guidelines outline the requirements and best practices for submitting Flutter applications to app stores such as the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Adhering to these guidelines ensures that applications meet platform-specific standards, policies, and technical requirements for distribution to users.

**Guidelines:**

- Familiarize yourself with the submission guidelines and policies of the target app stores, including Apple's App Store Review Guidelines and Google Play Developer Program Policies.
- Ensure that your Flutter application complies with platform-specific requirements related to content, functionality, user experience, and legal considerations, such as copyright infringement, privacy, and data security.
- Prepare necessary assets and metadata for app store listings, including app icons, screenshots, descriptions, keywords, and promotional materials, following the recommended dimensions, formats, and localization guidelines.
- Test your application thoroughly on target devices and platforms to identify and resolve any compatibility issues, performance issues, or usability concerns before submission.
- Address any feedback or rejection reasons provided by app store reviewers promptly, making necessary adjustments to your application to meet the platform's standards and requirements.
- Follow the submission and review process outlined by the app stores, including account registration, app submission, review timelines, and communication channels for inquiries or appeals.
- Stay informed about updates and changes to app store policies, guidelines, and submission processes to ensure ongoing compliance and successful app releases.

## Versioning and Release Notes

**Purpose:**

- Versioning and release notes guidelines define the practices for version management, release numbering, and release note documentation for Flutter applications. Versioning ensures clear communication of software changes, while release notes provide insights into new features, enhancements, and bug fixes for users and stakeholders.

**Guidelines:**

- Adopt a version numbering scheme, such as Semantic Versioning (SemVer), to indicate the significance of changes in each release, with major, minor, and patch version increments based on the scope and impact of changes.
- Maintain consistency in versioning across different distribution channels and platforms, including app stores, package managers, and version control repositories, to avoid confusion and ensure synchronization of releases.
- Document release notes for each version, summarizing the changes, improvements, bug fixes, and known issues addressed in the release, along with any additional instructions or considerations for users.
- Include relevant metadata, such as release dates, build numbers, and release channels, in versioning and release notes to facilitate tracking, auditing, and troubleshooting of software releases.
- Communicate release information proactively to users, stakeholders, and collaborators through release announcements, changelogs, release notes, and in-app notifications, keeping them informed about the latest updates and enhancements to the application.

## Play Store and App Store Guidelines

**Purpose:**

- Play Store and App Store guidelines provide specific instructions and requirements for publishing Flutter applications on Google Play Store and Apple App Store, respectively. Adhering to these guidelines ensures that applications meet platform-specific standards and policies for distribution and visibility to users.

**Guidelines:**

- Review the developer documentation and guidelines provided by Google Play Store and Apple App Store to understand the requirements and best practices for app submission, content moderation, and distribution.
- Ensure that your Flutter application complies with platform-specific guidelines related to app content, functionality, design, metadata, and monetization policies, addressing any violations or discrepancies before submission.
- Follow the technical requirements and recommendations for app packaging, signing, and distribution, including APK/IPA generation, metadata configuration, and compliance with security and privacy standards.
- Provide accurate and up-to-date information for app listings, including app title, description, screenshots, and promotional assets, following the platform's guidelines for formatting, localization, and promotional content.
- Stay informed about updates, changes, and announcements from Google Play Store and Apple App Store regarding policy changes, enforcement actions, and new features, ensuring ongoing compliance and optimization of app listings for visibility and engagement.
