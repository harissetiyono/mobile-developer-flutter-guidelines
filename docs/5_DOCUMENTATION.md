# 5. Documentation

## Feature Documentation Guidelines

**Purpose:**

- Feature documentation provides comprehensive information about newly developed features, including user stories, design specifications, and implementation details. It serves as a reference for developers, testers, and other stakeholders involved in the project.

**Requirements:**

- Document user stories or use cases that describe the intended functionality and behavior of the feature.
- Include design specifications, such as wireframes, mockups, or UI/UX designs, to visualize the feature's appearance and layout.
- Document implementation details, including code snippets, algorithms, or architectural diagrams, to explain how the feature is implemented.

## Code Commenting Standards

**Purpose:**

- Code comments enhance code comprehension by providing additional context, explanations, and clarifications about the code's purpose and behavior. Well-commented code facilitates maintenance, debugging, and collaboration among developers.

**Guidelines:**

- Use inline comments to explain complex or non-obvious code segments, algorithms, or business logic.
- Comment on the intent or rationale behind certain design decisions or implementation choices.
- Follow a consistent commenting style and language to ensure readability and uniformity across the codebase.

## README Template

**Purpose:**

- The README file serves as the entry point and documentation hub for the Flutter project. It provides essential information about the project, including its purpose, installation instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines.

## API Documentation

**Purpose:**

- API documentation describes the interfaces, functionalities, and usage guidelines of the project's APIs. It enables developers to understand how to interact with the APIs effectively and integrate them into their applications.

**Guidelines:**

- Document each API endpoint, class, method, or function, including its purpose, parameters, return values, and usage examples.
- Provide clear and concise explanations of any request or response payloads, query parameters, headers, or authentication mechanisms.
- Use consistent formatting, syntax highlighting, and organization to make the documentation easy to read and navigate.
